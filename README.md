# TIC-TAC-TOE-IN-PYTHON-USING-EXCEPTION-HANDLING


This is a tic-tac-toe game that is fully functional where you can try to enter anything to kill this program but it will handle all your exceptions and let you complete the game.

I have used Python, exception handling in Python, and Python module concepts to complete the game.

The main file is tictactoe.py while the other three files (tf.py, exc.py, wincheck.py) are modules (tf [Different Functions], exc [Exception Handling], wincheck [To Check Whether Someone Won Or Not]) for the main file.

Download the repository, simply run the tictactoe.py file, and start enjoying the Game!
