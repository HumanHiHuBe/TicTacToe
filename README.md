# TIC-TAC-TOE-IN-PYTHON-USING-EXCEPTION-HANDLING


this is tic-tac-toe game which is fully functional where you can enter anything to kill this program but it will handle all your exceptions and let you complete the game.
I have used python, exception handling in python and module writing like concepts to complete the game.

Main file is tictactoe.py while other three files (tf.py, exc.py, wincheck.py) are modules (tf [Different Functions], exc [Exception Handling], wincheck [To Check Whether Someone Won Or Not]) for the main file
